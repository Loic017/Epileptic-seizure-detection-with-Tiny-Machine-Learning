# Epileptic seizure-detection with Tiny Machine Learning: A dissertation study
Epileptic seizure detection with Tiny Machine Learning: a novel embedded algorithm that can detect three types of common seizures (absence, tonic-clonic, generalised non-specific) directly on a wearable device by employing a Tiny Machine Learning framework.

## Acknowledgements

This project was supervised by Nhat Pham.

## Publication

The preliminary results of this project have been submitted to the MobiUK 2024 symposium.

# Overview

This repository contains all files for the project, excluding raw EEG signals and datasets. Three models for each seizure including one combined model are trained, validated and tested. The models are converted to TFLite and deployed onto an Arduino. Quantisation are applied to reduce the model size.
