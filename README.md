# Epileptic seizure detection with Tiny Machine Learning: A dissertation study

Epileptic seizure detection with Tiny Machine Learning: A novel embedded algorithm that can detect three types of common seizures (absence, tonic-clonic, generalised non-specific) directly on a wearable device by employing Tiny Machine Learning models and EEG preprocessing techniques.

This repository contains the required code to reproduce this study, excluding raw EEG signals and datasets. Three models for each seizure type (including one combined model) are created on 16162 total seizure samples from the TUH Seizure corpus. This organised dataset contains a split of absence, tonic-clonic, generalised non-specific, and background samples. A Melspectrogram feature extraction solution is implemented, producing informative and small image representations. Reliable results are demonstrated with 80%+ and 90%+ GMean of specificity and sensitivity accross all three individual models as almost all seizure and background samples are predicted correctly.

Although the results of this study were positive, the scope of testing was constrained by limited data access and time restrictions. A larger dataset would likely yield more robust results and provide a more reliable demonstration of the study's findings.
